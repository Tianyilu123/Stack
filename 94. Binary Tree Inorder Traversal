Each node will be traversed once so time complexity is only O(n) if n denotes to counts of nodes in this tree.
For space complexity, using stack is just like using call stack in recursion approach. 
Therefore, itâ€™s space complexity will be the same with recursion approach, 
which is O(h) (or O(logn)) if h denotes to path length of the longest path in this tree.
